Hey there, 

I’m Marty, I’m an engineer of many trades, believing in a philisophy of the more trades one knows, the more trades one can fuse into some absurd solution.

I mostly spend my days on DNS, but I also have a love for infrastructure & networking. You’ll probably find me tinkering away on a Kubernetes stack, building networks or muttering it’s always DNS
